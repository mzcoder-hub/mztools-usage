Hello GitHub Support,

I want to sincerely apologize for the activities that led to my account being restricted. I now realize that by purchasing enterprise access from an unverified and non-credible source, I violated GitHub’s Terms of Service. At the time, I did not fully understand the consequences of such an action, but I take full responsibility for my mistake.

I understand the seriousness of this issue and the importance of protecting GitHub’s platform and community. I deeply regret my decision and assure you that this will never happen again. Moving forward, I will:

Only use legitimate, authorized means to access any GitHub services.
Strictly follow GitHub’s Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies.
Avoid any actions that could be seen as fraudulent, abusive, or circumventing platform rules.
GitHub is an important part of my work and learning, and I truly value the tools and community you provide. I humbly request that you reconsider the restrictions on my account. I am committed to full compliance and transparency going forward, and I hope to regain the opportunity to be a trusted member of the GitHub community again.

Thank you for taking the time to review my appeal and for giving me a chance to correct my actions.

Kind regards,
GALANG YOGA PRADANA
